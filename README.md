# World-Happiness-Report
For this project I have worked on the Kaggle data of world happiness report to discover the happiest countries of the world.


This Data contains the Happiness Score for 153 countries along with the factors used to explain the score.


The Happiness Score is explained by the following factors:
Economy
Family
Health (Life Expectancy)
Freedom
Trust (Government Corruption)
